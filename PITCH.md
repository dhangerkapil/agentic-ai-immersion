## 🎤 One-Liner Pitch

```
Agentic AI Immersion is a 55+ notebook workshop built on the NEW Azure AI Agents v2 experience - taking you from "Hello World" to multi-agent systems with human-in-the-loop patterns on Microsoft Foundry.
```

---

## 🗣️ Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

```
I built Agentic AI Immersion - a hands-on workshop for Microsoft Foundry using the NEW Agents v2 developer experience.

It has 55+ Jupyter notebooks covering everything from basic agents to complex workflows with human approval loops. 

The key difference? It's built on Foundry Agent Service - the upgraded runtime with server-side tool orchestration, built-in multi-agent support, and enterprise-grade observability.

Real use cases like loan processing, compliance review, and fraud detection - all patterns you can adapt for your needs.

The killer feature? Foundry IQ - it's agentic retrieval that makes your knowledge bases actually intelligent.

It's open source on GitHub, DevContainer included, ready to clone and run.
