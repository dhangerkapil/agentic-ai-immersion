    "# 🏦 Banking Document Search Agent Tutorial 📄\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Banking Document Search Agent** tutorial! We'll use **Microsoft Foundry** SDKs to build an assistant that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Upload** banking policy documents and loan guidelines into a vector store.\n",
    "2. **Create an Agent** with a **File Search** tool.\n",
    "3. **Search** these documents for loan policies, banking regulations, and compliance information.\n",
    "4. **Answer** customer and employee questions about banking products and procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Important Financial Disclaimer ⚠️\n",
    "> **All financial information in this notebook is for general educational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional financial or legal advice.** Always consult with qualified banking professionals and compliance officers for official guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔐 Required Roles\n",
    "1. **Azure AI Developer** on your Microsoft Foundry project.\n",
    "2. **Storage Blob Data Contributor** on the project's Storage account.\n",
    "3. If standard agent setup is used with your own Search resource, also ensure you have **Cognitive Search Data Contributor** on that resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌐 Storage Account Networking Configuration\n",
    "The file upload to vector stores requires network access to the storage account. If you encounter a **403 Forbidden** error during file upload, you need to configure the storage account networking:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to **Azure Portal** → Navigate to your AI Foundry project's **Storage Account**\n",
    "2. Go to **Networking** under **Security + networking**\n",
    "3. Under **Public network access**, select **\"Enabled from all networks\"**\n",
    "4. Click **Save** and wait 1-2 minutes for changes to propagate\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Important**: For workshops/testing, enabling \"from all networks\" is the most reliable option. Other configurations (selected networks, adding IP addresses, resource instances) may not work reliably for file uploads. For production environments, consult your security team for appropriate network configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's Get Searching!\n",
    "We'll show you how to upload sample banking documents, create a vector store for them, then spin up an agent that can search for loan policies, interest rates, and compliance guidelines. Enjoy!"

    "\n",
    "1. **Resource Management**\n",

    "   - Clear out test agents or vector stores once you're done.\n",

    "# Congratulations! 🎉\n",
    "\n",
    "You've successfully completed the **Banking Document Search Agent** tutorial! Here's what was accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ **What We Built**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔍 File Search Agent**\n",
    "- Created an AI agent with **FileSearchTool** capabilities\n",
    "- Enabled the agent to search through uploaded banking documents using semantic search\n",
    "- Configured banking-focused instructions with appropriate financial disclaimers\n",
    "\n",
    "### **📚 Key Features Demonstrated**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **📄 Vector Store & File Upload**\n",
    "   - Created a vector store using `openai_client.vector_stores.create()`\n",
    "   - Uploaded files directly to vector store using `openai_client.vector_stores.files.upload_and_poll()`\n",
    "   - Polled for completion status\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **🔎 Semantic Document Search**\n",
    "   - Agent searches through loan policies and compliance guidelines\n",
    "   - Provides relevant answers based on uploaded document contents\n",
    "   - Uses `FileSearchTool` class from `azure.ai.projects.models`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **🏦 Banking-Focused Responses**\n",
    "   - Agent answered questions about mortgage requirements, KYC policies, and business loans\n",
    "   - Provided responsible AI disclaimers about financial advice\n",
    "   - Referenced content from uploaded policy documents\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **🧹 Resource Management**\n",
    "   - Properly cleaned up vector stores and agents\n",
    "   - Demonstrated best practices for resource lifecycle management\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **Key Concepts Learned**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FileSearchTool**: The proper class from `azure.ai.projects.models` for file search\n",
    "- **Vector Stores**: Create empty first, then upload files with `upload_and_poll()`\n",
    "- **Polling Pattern**: Wait for vector store status to be \"completed\"\n",
    "- **Semantic Search**: Agents find relevant content even when exact words don't match\n",
    "- **Responsible AI**: Always include financial disclaimers for banking-related content\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 **API Methods Reference**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Description |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|\n",
    "| `openai_client.vector_stores.create()` | Create empty vector store |\n",
    "| `openai_client.vector_stores.files.upload_and_poll()` | Upload file and wait for processing |\n",
    "| `openai_client.vector_stores.retrieve()` | Check vector store status |\n",
    "| `FileSearchTool(vector_store_ids=[...])` | Create file search tool |\n",
    "| `project_client.agents.create_version()` | Create agent with tools |\n",
    "| `openai_client.conversations.create()` | Create conversation |\n",
    "| `openai_client.responses.create()` | Get agent response |\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 **Best Practices Recap**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Store Pattern** - Create empty vector store first, then upload files to it\n",
    "2. **Use FileSearchTool Class** - Import from `azure.ai.projects.models`\n",
    "3. **Polling** - Always wait for vector store status to be \"completed\"\n",
    "4. **Banking Content** - Always include financial disclaimers\n",
    "5. **Resource Cleanup** - Delete agents first, then vector stores\n",
    "6. **Error Handling** - Check for 403 errors indicating missing permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Guide**\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you get a 403 error during file upload:**\n",
    "1. ✅ Ensure you have **Storage Blob Data Contributor** role on the project's storage account\n",
    "2. ✅ Go to Azure Portal → Your AI Foundry project → Access control (IAM)\n",
    "3. ✅ Add role assignment for your user account\n",
    "4. ✅ Wait a few minutes for the role to propagate\n",
    "\n",
    "**If vector store creation fails:**\n",
    "1. ✅ Use the correct pattern: create empty store, then upload files\n",
    "2. ✅ Use `upload_and_poll()` instead of separate upload methods\n",
    "3. ✅ Check the vector store status after uploads\n",
