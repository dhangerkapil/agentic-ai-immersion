    "## 📝 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thread Management in Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thread Persistence**: Threads maintain conversation context across multiple interactions, essential for complex multi-turn discussions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating Threads**: Use `AgentsClient` to create threads before agent interactions:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   created_thread = await agents_client.threads.create()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using Existing Threads**: Connect agent to existing thread for conversation continuity:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   thread = agent.get_new_thread(service_thread_id=created_thread.id)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Thread Lifecycle**: Always clean up threads when conversation is complete:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   await agents_client.threads.delete(thread_id)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compliance**: Persistent threads create audit trails for regulatory compliance\n",
    "- **Customer Experience**: Customers don't need to repeat information\n",
    "- **Context-Aware Responses**: Agents can reference earlier parts of the conversation\n",
    "- **Multi-Step Processes**: Perfect for loan applications, account onboarding, and consultations\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Disclaimer\n",
    "This example uses simulated data for demonstration purposes. In production:\n",
    "- Connect to actual backend systems\n",
    "- Implement proper authentication and authorization\n",
    "- Follow all regulatory requirements\n",
    "- Ensure compliance for sensitive data"
