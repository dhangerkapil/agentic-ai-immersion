    "## Key Takeaways 📚\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async with (\n",
    "    AzureCliCredential() as credential,\n",
    "    AzureAIAgentsProvider(credential=credential) as provider,\n",
    "):\n",
    "    agent = await provider.create_agent(\n",
    "        name=\"my-agent\",  # Use hyphens, not underscores\n",
    "        instructions=\"...\",\n",
    "        tools=[tool1, tool2],\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Configuration Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent-Level Tools**: Defined at agent creation, available for all queries\n",
    "2. **Run-Level Tools**: Passed to specific `run()` calls\n",
    "3. **Mixed Tools**: Combine both patterns for flexible tool access\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Tools Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tool | Purpose |\n",
    "|------|---------|\n",
    "| `get_account_balance` | Check account balances |\n",
    "| `get_transaction_history` | View recent transactions |\n",
    "| `calculate_loan_payment` | Calculate loan payments |\n",
    "| `get_credit_score` | Check credit scores |\n",
    "| `get_investment_portfolio` | Review investment holdings |\n",
    "| `calculate_compound_interest` | Project investment growth |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool Typing**: Use `Annotated` and `Field` for clear parameter descriptions\n",
    "2. **Docstrings**: Include helpful docstrings for tool functions\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**: Handle missing or invalid inputs gracefully\n",
    "4. **Agent Names**: Use hyphens (not underscores) in agent names\n",
    "5. **Disclaimers**: Always include appropriate financial disclaimers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Account Management**: Balance checks, transaction history\n",
    "- **Loan Services**: Payment calculations, rate comparisons\n",
    "- **Investment Services**: Portfolio review, growth projections\n",
    "- **Credit Services**: Credit score checks, eligibility assessments\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Important**: All financial functions in this notebook use simulated data for demonstration. Real banking applications require secure connections to actual banking systems."
