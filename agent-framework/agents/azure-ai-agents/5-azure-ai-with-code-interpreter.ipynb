    "| `client.create_agent()` as context manager | `await provider.create_agent()` returns agent |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Interpreter Tool**: The `HostedCodeInterpreterTool` allows agents to execute Python code in a secure environment\n",
    "2. **Financial Calculations**: Perfect for compound interest, amortization, portfolio analysis, and risk assessment\n",
    "3. **Data Analysis**: Can perform financial modeling including projections and what-if scenarios\n",
    "4. **Code Visibility**: Access the actual code executed through `print_code_interpreter_inputs()`\n",
    "5. **Streaming Support**: Works with both streaming and non-streaming responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compound Interest Calculations**: Investment growth projections\n",
    "- **Loan Amortization**: Mortgage and loan payment schedules\n",
    "- **Portfolio Analysis**: Risk assessment and return calculations\n",
    "- **Investment Projections**: SIP, 401k, retirement planning simulations\n",
    "- **Break-even Analysis**: Business financial modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clear Instructions**: Specify the type of financial calculations needed\n",
    "2. **Error Handling**: The agent handles code errors gracefully\n",
    "3. **Resource Management**: Use async context managers for proper cleanup\n",
    "4. **Code Review**: Always review executed code for verification\n",
    "5. **Disclaimers**: Include appropriate financial disclaimers for all calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Important**: All financial calculations are for educational purposes only. Consult qualified professionals for actual financial decisions."
