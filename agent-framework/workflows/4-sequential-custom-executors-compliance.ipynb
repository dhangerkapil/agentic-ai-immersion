    "### Why Custom Executors for FSI?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Benefit | Description |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Guaranteed Compliance** | Code-based disclaimers can't be \"forgotten\" by AI |\n",
    "| **Audit Trail** | Deterministic processing for regulatory audits |\n",
    "| **Separation of Concerns** | AI handles advice, code handles compliance |\n",
    "| **Customizable** | Easily update disclaimers without retraining models |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industry Use Cases for Custom Executors\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Compliance Executor - Add required disclosures\n",
    "# PII Redactor - Remove sensitive data before logging\n",
    "# Rate Limiter - Throttle customer interactions\n",
    "# Audit Logger - Record all interactions for compliance\n",
    "# Sentiment Checker - Flag negative interactions for review\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Custom executors should be **lightweight and focused**\n",
    "- Add **error handling** for edge cases\n",
    "- Consider **timeout handling** for complex processing\n",
    "- **Test independently** before integration\n",
    "- **Log processing** for debugging and compliance"
