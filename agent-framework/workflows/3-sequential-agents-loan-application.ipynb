    "# 🏦 Sequential Workflow for Loan Application Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **sequential orchestration** using the `SequentialBuilder` API for a **loan application processing** workflow. Each agent processes the application in sequence, passing context to the next agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💼 Industry Use Case: Loan Application Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "A customer submits a loan application. The workflow processes it through two specialized agents:\n",
    "1. **Loan Analyst**: Reviews the application, checks eligibility criteria\n",
    "2. **Risk Reviewer**: Evaluates risk factors and provides final recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Important Financial Disclaimer\n",
    "> **This notebook is for educational and demonstration purposes only.** The loan processing logic shown here is simplified and should not be used for actual lending decisions. Always consult with licensed financial professionals and follow regulatory requirements.\n",

    "| **Incremental Building** | Each agent sees previous messages and builds on them |\n",
    "| **Final Output** | Complete conversation history with all agent responses |\n",
