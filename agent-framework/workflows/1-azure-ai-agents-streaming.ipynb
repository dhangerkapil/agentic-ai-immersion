    "# 🏦 Credit Card Application Review with Azure AI Agents Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **Azure AI Agents** with **streaming** for a credit card application review workflow. Watch real-time analysis as two specialized agents process an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💼 Industry Use Case: Credit Card Application Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "A customer submits a credit card application:\n",
    "1. **Credit Analyst Agent** - Reviews application and assesses creditworthiness\n",
    "2. **Underwriter Agent** - Makes final decision with terms and conditions (streaming output)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Important Financial Disclaimer\n",
    "> **This notebook is for educational purposes only.** The credit decision logic is simplified and should not be used for actual lending decisions. Always follow regulatory requirements and consult compliance teams.\n",
    "\n",

    "| Concept | Description |\n",

    "| **Azure AI Agent Service** | Using Azure-hosted agents with the Agent Framework |\n",
    "| **Streaming** | Real-time token generation via `AgentRunUpdateEvent` |\n",
    "| **register_agent()** | Lazy agent creation with factory functions |\n",
    "| **WorkflowBuilder** | Pipeline construction with edges between agents |\n",

    "2. **Shared Session**: All agents use the same authenticated client\n",
    "3. **Clean Separation**: Agent config separate from workflow logic\n",
