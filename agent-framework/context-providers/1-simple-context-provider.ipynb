    "# 👤 Simple Context Provider - Customer KYC Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to create a **Simple Context Provider** that manages customer profile information for KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features Covered:\n",
    "- Creating a custom `ContextProvider` class\n",
    "- Extracting structured information from conversations\n",
    "- Providing dynamic context to agents based on collected data\n",
    "- Managing conversation state across multiple turns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industry Use Case: Customer KYC Profile Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Our context provider will help banking agents:\n",
    "- Collect required customer identification information\n",
    "- Track KYC verification status\n",
    "- Enforce compliance rules (must collect info before providing services)\n",
    "- Store customer profile data for the session\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Important Disclaimer ⚠️\n",
    "> **This notebook is for educational purposes only. All customer information is simulated. In production, ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).**\n",
