    "### FSI Best Practices for Underwriting\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always Include Disclaimers**: Underwriting decisions require official policy adherence\n",
    "2. **Use Extractive Mode**: For auditability, use `knowledge_base_output_mode=\"extractive_data\"`\n",
    "3. **Minimal Reasoning**: Start with `retrieval_reasoning_effort=\"minimal\"` for faster responses\n",
    "4. **Source Attribution**: Ensure responses cite the source policy documents for compliance\n",
